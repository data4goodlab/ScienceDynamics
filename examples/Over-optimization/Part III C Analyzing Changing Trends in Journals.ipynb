Moreover, in both datasets, we discovered a sharp increase in the number of new journals, followed by a decrease in new journals; in the MAG dataset the decrease started in 2009, and in the SJR dataset it started in 2011. Interestingly enough, according to the SJR dataset, which seems to have more accurate data for the last decade, in 2010 there were 1380 new journals, while in 2015 there were only 352 new journals. We believe that this can be a direct result of the publishing of mega-journals, such as PLOS ONE that changed the academic publications eco-system. However, in 2016 the number of new journals had recovered with 1232 new journals. Nevertheless, the number of active journals has skyrocketed over the last 50 years.\n",
